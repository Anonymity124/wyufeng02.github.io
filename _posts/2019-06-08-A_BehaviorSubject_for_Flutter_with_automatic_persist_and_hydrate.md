# Hydrated

Hydrated provides a BehaviorSubject that automatically persists to Flutter's local storage and hydrates on creation!

## Easy to consume

All values are persisted with `shared_preferences` and restored with automatic hydration.

```dart
final count$ = HydratedSubject<int>("count", seedValue: 0);

/// count$ will automagically be hydrated with 42 next time it is created
count$.add(42);
```

## Ready for BLoC

```dart
class HydratedBloc {
  final _count$ = HydratedSubject<int>("count", seedValue: 0);

  ValueObservable<int> get count$ => _count$.stream;
  Sink<int> get setCount => _count$.sink;

  dispose() {
    _count$.close();
  }
}
```

## Supports simple types and serialized classes

We support all `shared_preferences` types.

- `int`
- `double`
- `bool`
- `String`
- `List<String>`

```dart
final count$ = HydratedSubject<int>("count");
```

We also support serialized classes with `hydrate` and `persist` arguments.

```dart
final user$ = HydratedSubject<User>(
  "user",
  hydrate: (String s) => User.fromJSON(s),
  persist: (User user) => user.toJSON(),
);
```

## Reliable

Hydrated is mock tested with all supported types and is dogfooded by its creator.

## Contributing

The goal of Hydrated is to make persistence of BLoC classes as simple as possible for Flutter projects. PRs are welcome, but be warned that I am committed to simplicity.
