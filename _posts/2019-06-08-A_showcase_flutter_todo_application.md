# flutter_todo

A showcase/portfolio todo app.

Inspired by https://dribbble.com/shots/3812962-iPhone-X-Todo-Concept

## The result

The app uses my own library [flutter_snaplist](https://github.com/ariedov/flutter_snaplist), for switching todo categories.

[flutter_redux](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/flutter_redux) is used for sharing state between different screens and widgets of the app.
