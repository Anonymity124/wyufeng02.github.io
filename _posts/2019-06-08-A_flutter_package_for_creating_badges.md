# Chips:
Sometimes you may want to use chip but it's too big, even if set padding to zero. This is where Badge comes handy.

```dart
    Chip(
      backgroundColor: Colors.deepPurple,
      padding: EdgeInsets.all(0),
      label: Text('BADGE', style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white)),
    ),
    Badge(
      badgeColor: Colors.deepPurple,
      shape: BadgeShape.square,
      borderRadius: 20,
      toAnimate: false,
      badgeContent:
          Text('BADGE', style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white)),
    ),
```


## Custom Usage
There are several options that allow for more control:

|  Properties  |   Description   |
|--------------|-----------------|
| `Widget badgeContent` | The content of badge. Usually `Text` or `Icon`. |
| `Color badgeColor` | Background color of the badge. |
| `Widget child` | The main widget. By default it's below the red badge. Usually `Icon`, `IconButton`, `Text` or button. |
| `double elevation` | Shadow of the badge. |
| `bool toAnimate` | Whether animate badge when badge content changed or not. |
| `BadgePosition position` | Can be one of `BadgePosition.topLeft()`, `BadgePosition.topRight()`, `BadgePosition.bottomLeft()`, `BadgePosition.bottomRight()`. Sometimes you want to create unique badge position or create new one manually. For this use `BadgePosition.topRight(top: -12, right: -20)` or `BadgePosition.(left, top, right, bottom)`. |
| `BadgeShape shape` | `BadgeShape.circle` or `BadgeShape.square`. You can use `borderRadius` to change border radius of badge of you use square `BadgeShape.square`. |
| `double borderRadius` | Border radius of badge. Applies only if `BadgeShape.square` is used. |
| `EdgeInsets padding` | The padding of badge content. |
| `Duration animationDuration` | The duration of badge animation when badge content is changed. |
| `BadgeAnimationType animationType` | Can be one of `BadgeAnimationType.slide`, `BadgeAnimationType.scale` or `BadgeAnimationType.fade`. |
