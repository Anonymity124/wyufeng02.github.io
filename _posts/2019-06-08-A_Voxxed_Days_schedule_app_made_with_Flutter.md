## What is voxxedapp?

It's an app that displays info about upcoming
[Voxxed Days](https://beta.voxxeddays.com/) conferences, including
location details, tracks, speaker lists, and schedules. Built using
[Flutter](https://flutter.io), voxxedapp is written in Dart and compiles
for both iOS and Android from a single codebase.

The app is currently in an open beta, but will be arriving in the App
and Play stores within a few weeks.
