SpaceX GO! - codenamed Project: Cherry, is an open-source unofficial SpaceX launch tracker app built for fun, and with educational purposes. 

### About the project
The only purpose of this project is to start developing native mobile apps, using the Flutter SDK. This development kit allows me to deploy it to Android & iOS with ease. The app has been developed to be light-weight, fast and easy to use. It takes all the data from the open-source r/SpaceX REST API, which can be found [here](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API).
