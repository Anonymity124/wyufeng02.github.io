A set of Flutter widgets that makes grouping Checkboxes and Radio Buttons much easier!

## Installing

Add the following to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

    dependencies:
      grouped_buttons: ^1.0.4

## Simple Usage
#### Creating a basic `CheckboxGroup`

    CheckboxGroup(
      labels: <String>[
        "Sunday",
        "Monday",
        "Tuesday",
        "Wednesday",
        "Thursday",
        "Friday",
        "Saturday",
        "Sunday",
      ],
      onSelected: (List<String> checked) => print(checked.toString())
    );

#### Creating a basic `RadioButtonGroup`

    RadioButtonGroup(
      labels: <String>[
        "Option 1",
        "Option 2",
      ],
      onSelected: (String selected) => print(selected)
    );

## Custom Usage
There are several options that allow for more control.

#### Custom `CheckboxGroup`
|   Properties  |  Description |
|---------------|--------------|
|`activeColor`  |The color to use when a Checkbox is checked.  |
|`checkColor`   |The color to use for the check icon when a Checkbox is checked.   |
|`checked`      |Specifies which boxes to be automatically checked. Every element must match a label. This is useful for clearing all selections (set it to []). If this is non-null, then the user must handle updating this list; otherwise, the state of the CheckboxGroup won't change. |
| `disabled`    |Specifies which boxes should be disabled. If this is non-null, no boxes will be disabled. The strings passed to this must match the labels. |
|`itemBuilder`  |Called when needed to build a CheckboxGroup element.   |
|`labels`       |(required) A list of strings that describes each Checkbox. Each label must be distinct. |
|`labelStyle`   |The style to use for the labels.   |
|`margin`       |Empty space surrounding the CheckboxGroup.   |
|`onChange`     |Called when the value of the CheckboxGroup changes.   |
|`onSelected`   |Called when the user makes a selection.   |
|`orientation`  |Specifies the orientation to display elements. Either `GroupedButtonsOrientation.HORIZONTAL` or `GroupedButtonsOrientation.VERTICAL`.  |
|`padding`      |Empty space in which to inset the CheckboxGroup.   |
|`tristate`     |If true the checkbox's value can be true, false, or null.   |

    List<String> _checked = ["A", "B"];

    CheckboxGroup(
      orientation: GroupedButtonsOrientation.HORIZONTAL,
      margin: const EdgeInsets.only(left: 12.0),
      onSelected: (List selected) => setState((){
        _checked = selected;
      }),
      labels: <String>[
        "A",
        "B",
      ],
      checked: _checked,
      itemBuilder: (Checkbox cb, Text txt, int i){
        return Column(
          children: <Widget>[
            Icon(Icons.polymer),
            cb,
            txt,
          ],
        );
      },
    );

#### Custom `RadioButtonGroup`
|   Properties  |  Description |
|---------------|--------------|
|`activeColor`  |The color to use when a Radio button is checked.  |
|`disabled`     |Specifies which buttons should be disabled. If this is non-null, no buttons will be disabled. The strings passed to this must match the labels. |
|`itemBuilder`  |Called when needed to build a RadioButtonGroup element.   |
|`labels`       |(required) A list of strings that describes each Radio button. Each label must be distinct.   |
|`labelStyle`   |The style to use for the labels.   |

|`padding`      |Empty space in which to inset the RadioButtonGroup.   |
|`picked`       |Specifies which Radio button to automatically pick. Every element must match a label. This is useful for clearing what is picked (set it to ""). If this is non-null, then the user must handle updating this; otherwise, the state of the RadioButtonGroup won't change. |

    String _picked = "Two";

    RadioButtonGroup(
      orientation: GroupedButtonsOrientation.HORIZONTAL,
