<img src="/assets/images/avata.png" alt="avata" align="right" width="150px"/>

I'm an open source fan, user, contributor.
I contributed and still contributing my work to several open source projects.
The one I contributed most is
[DBus](http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus/ "dbus"), and as honored as a
**committer** there.

Currently I'm interested in cloud computing, especially elastic computing.

Be interested in [Apache Mesos](http://mesos.apache.org/ "mesos") and computing
frameworks on-top of it, such like:

- [Apache Hadoop](http://hadoop.apache.org/ "hadoop")
- [Apache Storm](http://storm.incubator.apache.org/ "storm")
- [Airbnb Chronos](https://github.com/airbnb/chronos "chronos")
- ...

Not only target to a more effective data center for big data computing but also
for elastic service. Yes, based on [Docker](https://docker.com/ "docker").
We're now building a full featured private PaaS platform based on Docker.

I am also attracted by [openstack](http://www.openstack.org/ "openstack") and
willing to know more about it.
